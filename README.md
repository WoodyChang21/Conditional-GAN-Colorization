# Conditional GAN for Image Colorization

This project implements a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for image colorization. The model is trained on grayscale images of horses and learns to generate realistic colorized versions of them.

## Project Overview

- The dataset consists of grayscale images of horses.
- The generator is trained to predict realistic colorization for the grayscale inputs.
- The discriminator evaluates whether the generated images are realistic or not.
- The final evaluation is done using **FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID)** to measure similarity between generated and real images.

## Running on Google Colab

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Open **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the `.ipynb` notebook file.
3. Make sure to enable **GPU** for faster training (`Runtime > Change runtime type > Select GPU`).
4. Execute all cells to train the model.
5. The final colorized results will be displayed.

## Results

Below is an example output from the trained model.

- **First row:** Grayscale input images.
- **Second row:** Colorized images generated by the model.

The model successfully learns to restore colors to grayscale images, though some artifacts and blurriness may still be present.
