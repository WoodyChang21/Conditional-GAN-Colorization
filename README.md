# Conditional GAN for Image Colorization 🎨🖼️

This project implements a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** for **image colorization**, transforming grayscale images into colorized versions. The model is trained on a dataset of horse images and leverages a U-Net architecture for the generator and a CNN-based discriminator.

## 📌 Features
- Implements **Conditional GANs** (cGAN) for image-to-image translation.
- Uses **U-Net** as the generator and a CNN-based discriminator.
- Evaluates performance using **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**.
- Supports visualization of colorized outputs vs. grayscale inputs.
- Includes preprocessing and postprocessing
